### keep in mind it sometimes takes 20s for the application to run, because Heroku (free tier) :D

## Reflections

Its was pretty fun programming assignment to do and I've implemented this app in three different ways
- without express
- with express but es5, module, require stuff
- with express and es6, import, transpilation stuff (this repo)

CI/CD was something new to me but it seems to be working so I am happy about that.
